all these beauties will already be familiar
sixty silver domes
bronze statues
streets paved with lead
a crystal theater


he feels the desire for a city
spiral staircases encrusted with spiral seashells
perfect telsecopes and violins
the city of his dreams
desires are already memories


aluminum towers
seven gates
three hundred houses and seven hundred chimneys
the city in the past, present, and future
this path is only one of the many that opened before me


city of high bastions
the streets rising like staircases
the city does not consist of this
relationships between the measurements of its space
the events of its past
this wave of memories flows in
the city soaks it up like a sponge and expands
the city, however, does not tell its past
the lines of a hand
the corners of the streets
the gratings of the windows
the banisters of the steps
the poles of the flags
scratches
indentations
scrolls

Anastasia
concentric canals
the city's true essence
where no desire is lost
the treacherous city
you are only its slave


signboards jutting from the walls
things that mean other things
lions, dolphines, towers, starts
signals warn of what is forbidden
cornucopia
hourglass
function
the palace, the prison, the mint, the Pythagorean school, the brothel
signs of other things
scans the street as if they were written pages
the sky opens
a sailing ship, a hand, an elephant


recollections
remaining in your memory
succession of streets
houses along the streets
doors and windows
walking along the streets
the fountain with the nine jets
the astroner's glass tower
the melon vendor's kiosk
the statue of the hermit and the lions
the Turkish bath
the caf√© at the corner
the alley that leads to the harbor
motionless and always the same
languished, disintegrated disappeared


the pinnacles of the skyscrapers
white and red windsocks flapping
chimney belching smoke
a vessel that will take him away
foreign merchandise
a woman combing her hair
a camel from whose pack hang wineskins and bags
girls are dancing barefoot
a border city


distinct memories
a blind black man shouting in the crowd
a lunatic teetering on a skyscraper's cornice
a girl walking with a puma on a leash
in every skyscraper there is someone going merchandise
the city is redundant
it repeats itself so that something will stick
streets of shops
underground trains crammed
memory is redundant
it repeats signs
the city can begin to exist


city of the thousand wells
as far as the city extends
an invisible landscape
moves in the sunlight
a city that moves entirely upward


old post cards
as it used to be
the same identical square
the postcard city
prefer it to the present
regret at the changes
magnificence and propsperity of the metropolis
lost grace
look back with nostalgia
different cities follow one another
on the same site
under the same name
born and dying without knowing one another
whether the new ones are better or worse
a different city


gray stone metropolis
metal building
crystal globe
blue city
forms the city could have taken
imagined a way of making it the ideal city
no longer the same as before
a possible future
the city that corresponds to his desires
the map of your empire
equally relationships
all are only assumptions
a moment later, is possible no longer


the stranger arrives at the unknown
the princes' palaces, the high priests' temples
the tavern, the prison, the slum
unable to didistinguish the features of the city
place of indivisible existence
does the city exist?


platforms and balconies placed on stilts
various heights
crossing one another
linked by ladders and hanging sidewalks
need or command or desire
the city as we see it today
undecipherable plan
derived by combining elements of that first model
through the years and the changes continue to give their form to desires
desires either erase the city or are erased by it


merchants
pistachio nuts and poppy seeds
nutmegs and raisins
travel up rivers and cross deserts
everywhere the same
the long journey ahead
summoning up your memories one by one
wolf will have become another wolf
sister a different sister
battles other battles
the city where memory is traded


streets wound about themselves
men of various nations had an identical dream
an unknown city
they dreamed of pursuing her
lost
they never found it
they found one another
build a city like the one in the dream
the fugitive's trail
spaces and walls
that scene to be repeated
recognized something of the streets
no avenue of escape
this ugly city
trap


the palace with the highest domes
convicts with black chains on their features
the great library
shelves collapsing
a cloud of smoke
the dazed eyes of an adolscent
lips glued to an opium pipe
signs for a language
my spirit wants no stimulus
the day will come when my only desire will be to leave
there is no language without deceit


unfinished
demolished
enchantment or only a whim
no walls, no ceiling, no floors
it has nothing that makes it seem a city
where the houses should be
where the floors should be
indestructible
abandonded before or after it was inhabited
suspended in the void
the spurts, the splashes, the sponges' suds


a great city
the people who move through the streets are all strangers
imagine a thousand things
conversations, surprises, caresses, bites
eyes lock for a second
seeking other eyes
an exchange of glances
people happen to find themselves together
meetings, seductions, copulations, orgies
pursuots
pretenses
misunderstandings
clashes
carousel of fantasies


high streets
reflected, upside down
nothing exists or happens
its every point would be reflected in its mirror
the mirror increases a thing's value
twin cities
inverted
their eyes interlocked


the city must never be conufused with the words that describe it
rich in products and in profits
soot and grease
brawling streets
crush pedestrians against the walls
an action repeated by thousands of hands thousands of times
free life
refined civilization
glide at night



stone and marble and cement
factories
palaces
slaughterhouse
uproot
dismantle
take it off
vacant lots
remove the marble pediments
lower the stone walls
a complete life


capital
all these cities together
move to the next city
empty
good as new
life is renewed
the city repeats itself
identical
shifting up and down
remains always the same
the city is sacred


you cannot say that one aspect of the city is truer than the other
tne same stretches of street
detach it from the cobblestones
the cellars, the foundations, the wells



what was bizarre has become usual
what seemed normal is now an oddity
virtues and fault
solid and compact
what is needed to exist
exists less
colorless
without character
random
recollection of the other


over the void
hundreds and hundreds
passage
suspended over the abyss
uncertain
the net will last only so long


sustain the city's life
of blood, of trade, authority, agency
refugees
labyrinth
rebuild
intricate relationships seeking a form


clouds support the city
nothing of the city touches the earth
they hate the earth
they love it as it was before they existed
leaf by leaf
stone by stone
ant by ant


too numerous to be counted
new home
the city's soul
temporary guests
the environment before it was ruined
interrupting one another


population renews itself
die one by one
those who will take their places are born
there is a series of changes
a thousand inhabitants

city of water
network of canalas
network streets
span and intersect
network of routes
the pleasure of a new itinerary
secret and adventurous
cats, thieves, illicit lovers
conspirators and smugglers
evident and hidden

bridges over the canals
cobbles
gravel
blue and white tiles
the city offers surprises
the city fades
the rest of the city is invisible
a space in which routes are drawn between points suspended in the void
millions of eyes look
elude the gaze of all


 
everything I had imagined was forgotten
the sea is invisible from the city
the streets are long and straight
view
fragment
glimmer


encounter only the dead
alien faces
new face
old forms
the crowd that crammed those narrow streets
eyes, wrinkles, grimaces
dying


winding alleys
dead ends
the city's true form 
repetition that can be followed
the bustle, the throngs, the shoiving
it is easy to get lost
the true map of the universe is the city


hidden face


the glorious city
tormented history
decayed
fading
centuries of decadence, emptied by plague
nothing was lost
it was all there, merely arranged in a different order
overflow with new materials
the new city
destroying it
reconstruct through them a city of which no one knew anything now
populations and customs have changed several times
fragmentary and dead


the inhabitants have constructed an identical copy of their city, underground
every time they go below they find something changed
the dead make innovations
unrecognizable

the street you were seeking
your real destinaton
crooked streets
houses that crumble
screams in the darkness
street cleaners have to fall
rubbish
refashions
fresh
brand-new
up-to-disintegrated
expelling
discarding
cleansing
recurrent impurity

the streets are completely filled with dirt 
signs that had not changed at all 
the worst cannot be seen 
the city of monsters
bad dream
community life
cluster of constructions
crossroads
roads winding
road out of the city
house of the unborn
identical houses
erase the city
constant care
erase from the visible
straight in the eye
the eye does not see 
never stopping
her eyes restless 
natural desire
unjust city
inside the secret
peer deeper
temporal succession
confined
crammed
inextricable
come home
darkness falls
the blueprint
pattern of trhe streets
the city appears
the city may begin to crumble
fall to pieces
earlier city
new city
city of the living
this other city communicates
city of the dead
unhappy city
happy city
our city and the sky correspond so perfectly
far far away
the places have mingled
