Diomira
all these beauties will already be familiar
sixty silver domes
bronze statues
streets paved with lead
a crystal theater

Isidora
he feels the desire for a city
spiral staircases encrusted with spiral seashells
perfect telsecopes and violins
the city of his dreams
desires are already memories

Dorothea
aluminum towers
seven gates
three hundred houses and seven hundred chimneys
the city in the past, present, and future
this path is only one of the many that opened before me

Zaira
city of high bastions
the streets rising like staircases
the city does not consist of this
relationships between the measurements of its space
the events of its past
this wave of memories flows in
the city soaks it up like a sponge and expands
the city, however, does not tell its past
the lines of a hand
the corners of the streets
the gratings of the windows
the banisters of the steps
the poles of the flags
scratches
indentations
scrolls

Anastasia
concentric canals
the city's true essence
where no desire is lost
the treacherous city
you are only its slave

Tamara
signboards jutting from the walls
things that mean other things
lions, dolphines, towers, starts
signals warn of what is forbidden
cornucopia
hourglass
function
the palace, the prison, the mint, the Pythagorean school, the brothel
signs of other things
scans the street as if they were written pages
the sky opens
a sailing ship, a hand, an elephant

Zora
recollections
remaining in your memory
succession of streets
houses along the streets
doors and windows
walking along the streets
the fountain with the nine jets
the astroner's glass tower
the melon vendor's kiosk
the statue of the hermit and the lions
the Turkish bath
the caf√© at the corner
the alley that leads to the harbor
motionless and always the same
languished, disintegrated disappeared

Despina
the pinnacles of the skyscrapers
white and red windsocks flapping
chimney belching smoke
a vessel that will take him away
foreign merchandise
a woman combing her hair
a camel from whose pack hang wineskins and bags
girls are dancing barefoot
a border city

Zirma
distinct memories
a blind black man shouting in the crowd
a lunatic teetering on a skyscraper's cornice
a girl walking with a puma on a leash
in every skyscraper there is someone going merchandise
the city is redundant
it repeats itself so that something will stick
streets of shops
underground trains crammed
memory is redundant
it repeats signs
the city can begin to exist

Isaura
city of the thousand wells
as far as the city extends
an invisible landscape
moves in the sunlight
a city that moves entirely upward

Maurilia
old post cards
as it used to be
the same identical square
praise the postcard city
prefer it to the present one
regret at the changes
magnificence and propsperity of the metropolis
lost grace
look back with nostalgia at what it was
different cities follow one another
on the same site and under the same name
born and dying without knowing one another
whether the new ones are better or worse
a different city

Fedora
gray stone metropolis
metal building
crystal globe
blue city
forms the city could have taken
imagined a way of making it the ideal city
no longer the same as before
a possible future
the city that corresponds to his desires
the map of your empire
equally relationships
all are only assumptions
a moment later, is possible no longer

Zoe
the stranger arrives at the unknown
the princes' palaces, the high priests' temples
the tavern, the prison, the slum
unable to didistinguish the features of the city
place of indivisible existence
does the city exist?

Zenobia
platforms and balconies placed on stilts
various heights
crossing one another
linked by ladders and hanging sidewalks
need or command or desire
the city as we see it today
undecipherable plan
derived by combining elements of that first model
through the years and the changes continue to give their form to desires
desires either erase the city or are erased by it

Euphemia
merchants
pistachio nuts and poppy seeds
nutmegs and raisins
travel up rivers and cross deserts
everywhere the same
the long journey ahead
summoning up your memories one by one
wolf will have become another wolf
sister a different sister
battles other battles
the city where memory is traded

Zobeide
streets wound about themselves
men of various nations had an identical dream
an unknown city
they dreamed of pursuing her
lost her
they never found it
they found one another
build a city like the one in the dream
the fugitive's trail
spaces and walls
that scene to be repeated
recognized something of the streets
no avenue of escape
this ugly city
trap

Hypatia
the palace with the highest domes
convicts with black chains on their features
the great library
shelves collapsing
a cloud of smoke
the dazed eyes of an adolscent
lips glued to an opium pipe
signs for a language
my spirit wants no stimulus
the day will come when my only desire will be to leave
there is no language without deceit

Armilla
unfinished
demolished
enchantment or only a whim
no walls, no ceiling, no floors
it has nothing that makes it seem a city
where the houses should be
where the floors should be
indestructible
abandonded before or after it was inhabited
suspended in the void
the spurts, the splashes, the sponges' suds

Chloe
a great city
the people who move through the streets are all strangers
imagine a thousand things
conversa- tions, surprises, caresses, bites
eyes lock for a second
seeking other eyes
an exchange of glances
people happen to find themselves together
meetings, seductions, copulations, orgies
pursuots
pretenses
misunderstandings
clashes
carousel of fantasies

Valdrada
high streets
reflected, upside down
nothing exists or happens
its every point would be reflected in its mirror
the mirror increases a thing's value
the twin cities are not equally
inverted
their eyes interlocked

Olivia
the city must never be conufused with the words that describe it
rich in products and in profits
soot and grease
brawling streets
crush pedestrians against the walls
an action repeated by thousands of hands thousands of times
free life
refined civilization
glide at night


Sophronia
half-cities
stone and marble and cement
the bank, the factories, the palaces, the slaughterhouse, the school
uproot
dismantle
take it off
vacant lots
remove the marble pediments
lower the stone walls
a complete life

Eutropia
capital
all these cities together
move to the next city
empty
good as new
life is renewed
the city repeats itself
identical
shifting up and down
remains always the same
the city is sacred

Zemrude
you cannot say that one aspect of the city is truer than the other
tne same stretches of street
detach it from the cobblestones
the cellars, the foundations, the wells

Aglaura
array of proverbial virtues
proverbial faults
what was bizarre has become usual
what seemed normal is now an oddity
virtues and fault
solid and compact
what is needed to exist
exists less
colorless
without character
random
recollection of the other

Octavia
over the void
hundreds and hundreds
passage
support
suspended over the abyss
uncertain
the net will last only so long

Ersilia
sustain the city's life
of blood, of trade, authority, agency
refugees
labyrinth
rebuild
intricate relationships seeking a form

Baucis
clouds support the city
nothing of the city touches the earth
they hate the arth
they love it as it was before they existed
leaf by leaf
stone by stone
ant by ant

Leandra
too tiny to be seen 
too numerous to be counted
new home
they belong to the house
the city's soul
temporary guests
the environment before it was ruined
interrupting one another

Melania
caught in a dialogue
parasite
population renews itself
die one by one
those who will take their places are born
there is a series of changes
a hundred. a thousand inhabitants

Esmeralda
city of water
network of canalas
network streets
span and intersect
zigzag
network of routes
the pleasure of a new itinerary
secret and adventurous
cats, thieves, illicit lovers
conspirators and smugglers
evident and hidden

Phyllis
bridges over the canals
cobbles
gravel
blue and white tiles
the city offers surprises
spend the rest of your days there
the city fades
the rest of the city is invisible
a space in which routes are drawn be- tween points suspended in the void
millions of eyes look
elude the gaze of all

Pyrrha
conjured up
everything I had imagined was forgotten
the sea is invisible from the city
the streets are long and straight
view
light
buzzing
figure
fragment
glimmer

Adelma
encounter only the dead
alien faces
new face
old forms
the crowd that crammed those narrow streets
eyes, wrinkles, grimaces
dying

Eudoxia
winding alleys
dead ends
the city's true form 
repetition that can be followed
the bustle, the throngs, the shoiving
it is easy to get lost
the true map of the universe is the city

Moriana
villas all of glass
hidden face

Clarice
theg glorious city
tormented history
decayed
fading
centuries of decadence, emptied by plague
nothing was lost
it was all there, merely arranged in a different order
overflow with new materials
the new city
destroying it
pride in its new wealth
reconstruct through them a city of which no one knew anything now
populations and customs have changed several times
fragmentary and dead

Eusapia
the inhabitants have constructed an identical copy of their city, underground
every time they go below they find something changed
the dead make innovations
unrecognizable

Beersheba
