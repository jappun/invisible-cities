Diomira
all these beauties will already be familiar
sixty silver domes
bronze statues of all the gods
streets paved with lead
a crystal theater

Isidora
he feels the desire for a city
spiral staircases encrusted with spiral seashells
perfect telsecopes and violins
the city of his dreams
desires are already memories

Dorothea
aluminum towers
seven gates
spring-operated moats
three hundred houses and seven hundred chimneys
the city in the past, present, and future
this path is only one of the many that opened before me

Zaira
city of high bastions
the streets rising like staircases
the city does not consist of this
relationships between the measurements of its space
the events of its past
this wave of memories flows in
the city soaks it up like a sponge and expands
the city, however, does not tell its past
the lines of a hand
the corners of the streets
the gratings of the windows
the banisters of the steps
the antennae of the lightning rods
the poles of the flags
scratches
indentations
scrolls

Anastasia
concentric canals
kites flying over
the city's true essence
where no desire is lost
the treacherous city
you are only its slave

Tamara
signboards jutting from the walls
things that mean other things
lions, dolphines, towers, starts
signals warn of what is forbidden
